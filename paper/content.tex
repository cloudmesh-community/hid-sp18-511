In today's world data comes in different format (structured data,
semi-structured and unstructured data), high volume (data size is upto
hundreds of terabytes) and high velocity (amount of data getting
generated per second is too huge). Also, with the growing demand of cloud there is massive amount of
on-premise as well as cloud-based data.  Every organization has a necessity
to integrate such kind of data between on-premise and cloud-based
systems for synchronization, replication or building warehouse for
analysis and reporting purpose. Organization need to understand the data and get inside about the data for the business decision. Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services
(IICS)~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} provide complete suite of integration
for such kind of diverse and unique requirement. Customers can use the features of Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services (IICS)~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} to fulfill the data related need.

\section{Introduction}

Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services (IICS)~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} is built on micro service
architecture and provide capability of data integration between
cloud-based and on-premise systems. Informatica Intelligent Clod
Services IICS~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} provide integration capability
in four areas mainly Integration Cloud, Data Quality and Governance
Cloud, Master Data Management Cloud, and Data Security Cloud.

\section{Integration Cloud}

Integration Cloud~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} product provide easy to use
framework and designer for developing data integration engine between on-premise
and cloud-based systems. It has high performance data transformations including filter, router, expression etc. to massage the data in desired format. It has push-down optimization
capability for fast performance to move the data processing logic to database itself
instead of retrieving the data and performing the operations in Integration Cloud~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics}. It provide the
connectivity between cloud based databases like Amazon
Redshift~\cite{hid-sp18-511-aws-redshift}, Microsoft Azure SQL Data
Warehouse~\cite{hid-sp18-511-ms-azure-sql}, Google
BigQuery~\cite{hid-sp18-511-google-bigquery}, and
Snowflake~\cite{hid-sp18-511-snowflake} and on-premise legacy databases.

\subsection{Changed Data Capture}

Integration Cloud~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} has changed data capture functionality to capture only the changed data at source system and replicate to downstream systems. This way replication is fast and as only changed data gets processed instead of bulky process of moving the entire data from source to downstream systems.

\subsection{Access Policy}

Integration Cloud~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} has access policy to determine who can access what. Administrators can easily provide the permission to different project and folders based on the requirement to different users.

\subsection{Amazon S3 integration}

Integration Cloud~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} provide tool to move the data from flat files on-premise systems to cloud based Amazon file store (S3)~\cite{hid-sp18-511-aws-s3}. This is useful for the mass ingestion of the data.

\subsection{Development framework}

Integration Cloud~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} provide easy to use designer to develop the integration logic and monitor tool to check the progress of integration flow.

\section{Data Quality and Governance Cloud}

With the massive amount of data available in today's world it is very
important that we have access to the clean and quality data. Information can be
retrieved and analysis could be performed only if we have the good
quality data with we could rely upon and trust. Data Quality and
Governance Cloud~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} product provide tools to
visualize the data quality issues present in the data and fix them in automated way. It
also provide tools to verify and correct the common data related
issues like update the address of people and organization based on the
available address database, update the email addresses based on the
common email address rules, update the phone numbers based on the phone rules etc.

\section{Master Data Management Cloud}
Master Data Management Cloud~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} provide 360 view
of customer data by consolidating the customers data from different
systems. This is very important for any organization to get the full view of the customer in a holistic way and make the decisions accordingly. Customer data is normally stored in different systems having different perspective. This kind of data which is stored at multiple places doesn't server any purpose unless it is integrated and analyzed.

\section{Data Security Cloud}
Testing is a real need for validating the application before it could be used for the real purpose. No one is ready to use any system until it's authenticity is proven. However, providing
live data for testing is a risk and data could be
compromised. Data breach might leas to lot of compliance issues and might risk the position of the organization and ultimately business loss. Hence, there is a real need to provide the look like real data without compromising it. Data Security Cloud\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics}
provide tool to mask the data before sharing it with anyone which
will convert the data without loosing the shape of the data
