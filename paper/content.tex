In today's world data comes in different format (structured data,
semi-structured data and unstructured data), different volume (data size is upto
hundreds of terabytes) and high velocity (amount of data getting
generated per second is too huge). Also, with the growing demand of cloud there is massive amount of
cloud-based data as well as on-premise data. This data is sitting ideal in the systems and every organization has a necessity to integrate such kind of data between on-premise and cloud-based
systems for synchronization, replication or building warehouse for
analysis and reporting purpose. Organization need to understand the data and get inside about it for business decision. 

Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services
(IICS)~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} provide complete suite of integration
for such kind of diverse and unique requirement. Customers can use the features of Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services (IICS)~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} to fulfill the data related need. This could help to integrate data in different format like text file, csv files, databases, on-premise ERP systems, cloud-based systems and many more.

\section{Introduction}

Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services (IICS)~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} is built on micro service
architecture and provide capability of data integration between
cloud-based and on-premise systems. Informatica Intelligent Clod
Services IICS~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} provide integration capability
in four areas mainly Integration Cloud, Data Quality and Governance
Cloud, Master Data Management Cloud, and Data Security Cloud.

Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services (IICS)~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} processing engine which is called integration engine could be run in the cloud or on-premise. In case of on-premise processing customer has to download the integration agent and use that for the processing logic.

Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services (IICS)~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} comes under the category of Integration platform as aa service (iPAAS)~\cite{hid-sp18-511-ipaas}

As Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services (IICS)~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} is in the cloud hence customer need not to worry about the maintenance or upgrade of the software. The underlying hardware maintenance, OS patching, software upgrade etc. maintenance tasks will be performed by Informatica and customer has to focus only on the business logic. There are different type of pricing options available for the product!\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics-pricing}. Customer has the option to use pricing model as per the requirement and need.

As Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services (IICS)~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} provide 30-day free trial. This free trial could be used to evaluate the product and make the decision based on the features provided by the product.

Informatica provide very robust easily accessible Global Customer Support (GCS)~\cite{hid-sp18-511-gcs}service. This team is a set of dedicated people who are ready to help in resolving the questions related to pricing, technical queries or any other kind of help. 

\section{Integration Cloud}

Integration Cloud~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} product provide easy to use
framework and designer for developing data integration engine between on-premise
and cloud-based systems. It provide easy to develop interface for fast and easy development of integration logic. It has high performance data transformations including filter, router, expression etc. to massage the data in desired format. These transformations are ready to use and can be used in any data processing. Each transformation has different customization option which customer could use as per the requirement. It has push-down optimization feature
for fast performance to move the data processing logic to database itself
instead of retrieving the data and performing the operations in Integration Cloud~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics}. push-down optimization feature is really helpful to improve the performance of the integration logic. It provide the
connectivity between cloud based databases like Amazon
Redshift~\cite{hid-sp18-511-aws-redshift}, Microsoft Azure SQL Data
Warehouse~\cite{hid-sp18-511-ms-azure-sql}, Google
BigQuery~\cite{hid-sp18-511-google-bigquery}, and
Snowflake~\cite{hid-sp18-511-snowflake} and on-premise legacy databases for the integration between these systems.

\subsection{Easy to use interface}
Integration Cloud~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} provide easy to use, common framework for developers and administrators. This interface is consistent across all products. As the development framework is in the cloud hence it could be accessed from anywhere and anytime.

\subsection{Fast development}
Integration Cloud~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} provide pre-built logic which customer can use and customize as per their need. There is no need to develop the logic from scratch. This helps in fast development. Time to market is a concern in today's IT industry and availability to deliver in the market fast is very important. The pre-built logic helps organization to deliver in the market very fast. Customer can prepare the logic from scratch too if they want. 

\subsection{Changed Data Capture}

Integration Cloud~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} has changed data capture functionality to capture only the changed data at source system and replicate to downstream systems. This way replication is fast and as only changed data gets processed instead of bulky process of moving the entire data from source to downstream systems.

\subsection{Access Policy}

Integration Cloud~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} has access policy to determine who can access and what. Administrators can easily provide the permission to different project and folders based on the requirement to different users using easy graphical user interface. There could be multiple projects and different set of people could be working on those projects. There is a need to separate the access across team so one team can not access the work done by others. Also, there is a need to separate the access between lower environments and higher environments. Developers can run the integration logic in development environment but they should not be able to run the integration engine in higher environments. Access policy is very important in any organization and Integration Cloud~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} provide easy way to do this.

\subsection{Amazon S3 integration}

Integration Cloud~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} provide tool to move the data from flat files on-premise systems to cloud based Amazon file store (S3)~\cite{hid-sp18-511-aws-s3}. This is useful for the mass ingestion of the data. Multiple set of files could be move to S3 in a single click.

\subsection{Development framework}

Integration Cloud~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} provide easy to use designer to develop the integration logic and monitor tool to check the progress of integration flow.

\subsection{Application integration at run time}

Integration Cloud~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} provide functionality to integrate cloud based application like Salesforce~\cite{hid-sp18-511-salesforce} with on-premise systems like databases in real time. Real time integration happens through RESTful APIs. Developers have to provide the RESTful APIs to be called when an event occurs in Salesforce~\cite{hid-sp18-511-salesforce} system like customer added, order made etc. RESTFul APIs will be called once such event occur which have the logic to push the data to legacy systems like databases. All this happen in the real time. There are few security related configuration that organization have to provide.

\subsection{Business to Business integration}

Integration Cloud~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} provide transformation to deal with industry standards format like Electronic Data Exchange (EDI)~\cite{hid-sp18-511-edi}. Customer can easily leverage the industry standards with legacy systems to understand or transform the data. B2B tools provide tool for easy integration of industry standard formats.

\section{Data Quality and Governance Cloud}

With the massive amount of data available in today's world it is very
important that we have access to the clean and quality data. Information can be
retrieved and analysis could be performed only if we have the good
quality data with we could rely upon and trust. Incorrect data means incorrect analysis and ultimately incorrect decision which might lead to business loss. Data Quality and
Governance Cloud~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} product provide tools to
visualize the data quality issues present in the data and fix them in automated way. It
also provide tools to verify and correct the common data related
issues like update the address of people and organization based on the
available address database, update the email addresses based on the
common email address rules, update the phone numbers based on the phone rules etc. Data Quality is very first and important process in data analyis.

\section{Master Data Management Cloud}
Master Data Management Cloud~\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics} provide 360 view
of customer data by consolidating the customers data from different
systems. This is very important for any organization to get the full view of the customer in a holistic way and make the decisions accordingly. Customer data is normally stored in different systems having different perspective. The data could be on Salesforce\cite{hid-sp18-511-salesforce} and it could be on legacy on-premise systems like database. This kind of data which is stored at multiple places doesn't server any purpose unless it is integrated and analyzed.

\section{Data Security Cloud}
Testing is a real need for validating the application before it could be used for the real purpose. No one is ready to use any system until it's authenticity and functionality is proven. However, providing
live data for testing is a risk and data could be
compromised. Data breach might lead to lot of compliance issues and might risk the position of the organization and ultimately business loss. Hence, there is a real need to provide the real live look like real data without compromising it. Data Security Cloud\cite{hid-sp18-511-iics}
provide tool to mask the data before sharing it with anyone which
will convert the data without loosing the shape of the data
