\begin{abstract}

This project is about developing a module for automated deployment of
Apache Spark~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-spark} cluster on AWS(Amazon Web
Services)~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-aws} EC2(Elastic Compute
Cloud)~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-ec2} instances on a single click. This
module will take care of different infrastructure related items like
provisioning of EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud)~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-ec2}
instance, setting up the public/private key pair for secure connection,
inbound/outbound traffic rules on provisioned machines to allow
connectivity on various ports. This module will also perform Apache
Spark~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-spark} installation on the provisioned
EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud)~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-ec2} instances using
master/worker model. One of the machine will work as master node and
other machines will work as worker node. The script will expose
various options for Spark cluster deployment, execution of commands on
Spark cluster, shutting off the machines and termination of machine.

\section{Introduction}

AWS(Amazon Web Services)~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-aws} is cloud service
provider that provide different type of on-demand services to
customers. AWS(Amazon Web Services)~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-aws} provide
various services to customer in Infrastructure as a service, Platform as a
service, Software as a service categories. EC2(Elastic Compute
Cloud)~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-ec2} is compute service provided by
AWS(Amazon Web Services)~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-aws} for easy and fast
provision of compute resources of different type based on the
requirement. Apache Spark~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-spark} is an open source
project which use in-memory data for fast and optimized operation and
use Apache Hadoop~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-hadoop} as underlying
framework. Ansible~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-ansible} is an open source automation platform
for configuration management and application
deployment. Ansible~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-ansible} tool will be used
in this project to deploy Apache Spark~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-spark}
cluster on EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud)~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-ec2}
instances and perform various tasks on Apache
Spark~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-spark}.

\section{Resources}
This project will provide various option for deployment and
configuration

\begin{itemize}
	\item Deploy Spark Cluster
        \item Shutdown Spark Cluster
        \item Terminate Spark Cluster
        \item Execute Command on Spark Cluster
\end{itemize}
