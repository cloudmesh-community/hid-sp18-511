\begin{abstract}

This project is about developing a module for automated deployment of
Apache Spark~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-spark} cluster on AWS (Amazon Web
Services)~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-aws} EC2(Elastic Compute
Cloud)~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-ec2} instances on a single click. This
module will take care of different infrastructure related items like
provisioning of EC2~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-ec2}
instance, setting up the public/private key pair for secure connection,
inbound/outbound traffic rules on provisioned machines to allow
connectivity on various ports. This module will also perform Apache
Spark~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-spark} installation on the provisioned
EC2~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-ec2} instances using
master/worker model. One of the machine will work as a master node and
other machines will work as worker node. The script will expose
various options for Apache Spark~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-spark} cluster deployment, execution of commands on
Apache Spark~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-spark} cluster, shutting off the machines and termination of machines.

\section{Introduction}

AWS~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-aws} is a cloud service
provider that provides different types of on-demand services to the
customers. AWS~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-aws} provides
various services to thw customers in Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a
Service and Software as a Service categories. EC2~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-ec2} is a compute service provided by
AWS~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-aws} for easy and fast
provisioning of compute resources of different type based on the
requirement. Apache Spark~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-spark} is an open source
project which use in-memory data for fast and optimized operation and
use Apache Hadoop~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-hadoop} as underlying
framework. Ansible~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-ansible} is an open source automation platform
for configuration management and application
deployment. Ansible~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-ansible} tool will be used
in this project to deploy Apache Spark~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-spark}
cluster on EC2~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-ec2}
instances and perform various tasks on Apache
Spark~\cite{hid-sp18-511-www-spark}.

\section{Resources}
This project will provide various options for deployment and
configuration.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Deploy Spark Cluster
        \item Shutdown Spark Cluster
        \item Terminate Spark Cluster
        \item Execute Command on Spark Cluster
\end{itemize}
